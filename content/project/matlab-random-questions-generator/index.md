The application is an online examination application written purely in Matlab. It generates random multiple-choice questions (hereby referred to as MCQs) based on the number of students in a class. The code employs many decision functions to check logical and illogical entries. The application enables students to register for the examination, take the examination and get results immediately. Text files are created to hold the index numbers of students, course codes, and index number of students who registered for a particular course. The application is for academic purposes and has the potential of scalability.
