summary: This project provides a comparative study of common edge detection
  operators in image processing using mean squared error (MSE), peak signal to
  noise ratio (PSNR), and Execution time (Et). The paper shows the canny edge
  detector is computationally expensive but provides higher accuracy in edge
  detection with higher PSNR and lower MSE. The software tool used in the
  project is MATLAB SIMULINK R2020a.
