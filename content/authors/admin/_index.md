**Background:** I am a software developer at [Broadspectrum](https://broadspectrumdigitalpayments.com/) Ghana, where I help build payment gateways. Before joining Broadspectrum, I obtained a first-class bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have always been involved in interdisciplinary research that sought to address the many problems we face as a country, continent, and race. I also served as the organizing secretary of the Association of Computer Engineering Students (ACES), KNUST, where I helped run programs that sought to bridge the classroom-industry gap among the students.

**Research Interests**: My primary research interests include Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, Embedded Systems and Internet of Things (IoT). I am very interested in working at the intersection of Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) to build the next generations of intelligent computer systems that would allow us to fully harness the power of AI/ML for solving problems. I am very open to exploring new fields and learning about new things.

I have built a couple of startups. Key among them is [FarmSens](http://farmsens.netlify.app/), the next-generation smart soil sensors with real-time farm analytics. I spend most of my free time running and improving FarmSens. I also love to volunteer on a number of initiatives, from teaching high school students Maths and Science to providing technical and business mentorship to budding entrepreneurs in Kumasi, Ghana.

I am fellow of the [Resolution Group](https://resolutionproject.org/fellows/john-kwame-dunyo/), USA. and the [Jim Leech Mastercard Enterprenuership Programm](https://www.queensu.ca/gazette/stories/application-period-now-open-jim-leech-mastercard-foundation-fellowships) at Queen's University, Ontario, Canada.
